## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alessio Zanga, a PhD student at [Roche](https://www.roche.com/) in collaboration with [University of Milan - Bicocca](https://en.unimib.it/) in a reasearch project titled ["Structural Causal Models: Static and Dynamic Causal Networks for Health and Medicine"](https://www.unimib.it/sites/default/files/no-index/ndottorato/Computer_Science-PhdProjects_37.pdf).

### Working on :construction_worker:

I'm actively working on:

- :evergreen_tree: Fast and safe implementation of graph theory with [GRATHE](https://github.com/AlessioZanga/grathe),
- :microscope: Causal inference using graphical models with [CaMo](https://github.com/AlessioZanga/CaMo).

Previously worked on:

- :brain: Neural networks applied to neuroscience with [PyEEGLab](https://github.com/AlessioZanga/PyEEGLab),
- :crystal_ball: Bayesian networks for missing data with [MADBayes](https://github.com/madlabunimib/MADBayes),
- :robot: Reinforcement learning for general purpose with [REILLY](https://github.com/AlessioZanga/REILLY).

### Speaking of :speech_balloon:

I *really* like functional programming and scientific programming. I'm quite fluent in Python :snake: and C++ :wrench:, while currently learning Rust :crab:. Even if those languages are like day :sun_with_face: & night :first_quarter_moon_with_face:, I enjoy mixing them together for easy usage :smile_cat: and blazing performance :zap: (with related headache :dizzy_face:).

I've also experimented with different tools, like:

- :octocat: Git, GitHub and GitLab ('cause one will never be enough),
- :rocket: Travis and Jenkins for CI/CD development,
- :whale2: Doker for lightweight container shipping,
- :dart: TensorFlow and Keras for research purposes.

### Reading about :books:

If you are interested in some readings:

- ["ACTA: A Mobile-Health Solution for Integrated Nudge-Neurofeedback Training for Senior Citizens"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08692)
- ["Comparison of Attention-based Deep Learning Models for EEG Classification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01074)
- ["An Attention-based Architecture for EEG Classification"](https://doi.org/10.5220/0008953502140219)
