## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alessio Zanga, a computer scientist interested in anything that is learning-related!  

### Working on :construction_worker:

I'm actively working on:

- :brain: Neural networks applied to neuroscience with [PyEEGLab](https://github.com/AlessioZanga/PyEEGLab)
- :crystal_ball: Bayesian networks for missing data with [MADBayes](https://github.com/madlabunimib/MADBayes)
- :robot: Reinforcement learning for general purpose with [REILLY](https://github.com/CavenaghiEmanuele/REILLY)

### Speaking of :speech_balloon:

I *really* like functional programming and parallel computing (I'm on the <span style="color:green">green</span> CUDA side, sorry :stuck_out_tongue:). I'm quite fluent in Python :snake: and C++ :wrench:, sometimes also use C :hammer: and Java :coffee:. Even if those languages are like day :sun_with_face: & night :first_quarter_moon_with_face:, I enjoy mixing them together with PyBind and Numba for easy usage :smile_cat: and blazing performance :zap: (with related headache :dizzy_face:).

I've also experimented with different tools, like:

- :octocat: Git, GitHub and GitLab ('cause one will never be enough)
- :rocket: Travis and Jenkins for CI/CD development
- :dolphin: MySQL Workbench for database management
- :whale2: Doker for lightweight container shipping
- :office: Laravel for JSON backend endpoints
- :a: Angular for responsive website building
- :dart: TensorFlow and Keras for research purposes

### Reading about :books:

If you are interested in some readings:

- ["An Attention-based Architecture for EEG Classification"](https://doi.org/10.5220/0008953502140219)
